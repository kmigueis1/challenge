To setup the rails project after cloning onto your machine, run 'bundle install' in terminal to install ruby gems.
Once done, run 'npm install' to install all node packages.
Run 'bundle exec rails db:create', 'bundle exec rails db:migrate', and 'bundle exec rails db:seed' to setup the postgreSQL database.
Run 'rails s' to open rails server. Open a browser and paste 'localhost:3000' into the top bar to load the project.
